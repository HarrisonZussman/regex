# regex

A regex, or a regular expression, is a specific sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text. The most commonly used search patterns are string-searching or algorithms that find operations in strings which is used in input validation. Regex techniques were developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory. When you see regex it help to look for common ground to recognize it for example (/^(-----+)@([/-------]+).([-----]{---})$/.)

## Summary

The regex I will be covering is one that matches majority of email addresses. When validating emails, a good practice, which can almost be sure that a user will match the regex, is to limit what characters can input. The best way to guide the user into the regex method is by making them input something like 'gmail.com', 'yahoo.com', or 'xfinity.com' at the end of there email addresses.
